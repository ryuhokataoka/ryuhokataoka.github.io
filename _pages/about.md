Modern society has been supported by advanced technology as represented by satellites, which is susceptible to the space environmental change. So-called **space weather forecast** will therefore be important throughout the world in the future. The more we study the near-Earth space environment, the more mysterious it becomes, and the more academic interest emerges. Understanding extremely large solar flares, giant magnetic storms, and their possible effects on the modern society are the hot research topics. The book [Extreme Space Weather](https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780128225370/extreme-space-weather) is aimed for graduate students and researchers in a hurry to be able to get an overview in a short period of time, about the underlying physics, actual data of complex space weather phenomena, examples of historical events, the current state of the art in the simulation research and challenges in forecasting, and the negative impact on future lunar and Mars exploration.
