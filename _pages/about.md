Modern society has relied heavily on advanced technologies such as satellites and they are vulnerable to changes in space environment. Consequently, the importance of space weather forecasting is growing. As we delve deeper into the near-Earth space environment, its mysteries multiply, fueling increased academic interest. Key research areas include understanding the dynamics of massive solar flares, giant magnetic storms, and their potential impacts on contemporary society. The book [Extreme Space Weather](https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780128225370/extreme-space-weather) targets graduate students and researchers seeking a comprehensive overview of the underlying physics, datasets on complex space weather phenomena, historical event case studies, the latest advancements in simulation research, forecasting challenges, and the potential ramifications for future lunar and Mars exploration.

: Weather and climate matter in our daily life to plan our short-term and long-term future activities. The space weather and space climate also influence our high-tech society. The variable situations of sunspots, solar wind, cosmic rays, geomagnetic field, and auroras are typical examples of the space weather. This chapter briefly introduces the basic items of space weather with some examples of extreme space climate, such as Maunder Minimum, geomagnetic reversals, and nearby supernova occurrence.

Space is explosive. That is relatively a new concept. Against a classic Newtonian recognition of stars in the heaven, heavy stars die and explode in the galaxy, which are observed as supernovae. In our solar system, plasma environment is unstable and often exhibits explosions. The explosive energy release from the Sun can be categorized as electromagnetic burst (solar flares), plasma eruptions (coronal mass ejections), and accelerated energetic particles (solar protons). The magnetosphere of the Earth also shows similar explosions called auroral substorms, sharing the same principle of plasma physics.
