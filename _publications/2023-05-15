* Around 10–15 Rj in the equatorial plane, precession effect overwhelms interchange for the outward transport of Io plasma

* Io plasma is interchange unstable around 15–20 Rj and here diffuses outward while being mixed with H+ from the ionosphere

* The equatorial diffuse emission is projected with the low-speed polar wind to the outer shell of the Io torus around 15–20 Rj in the equatorial plane
