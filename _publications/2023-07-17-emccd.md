* An integrated package of instruments for high-time resolution measurements of pulsating aurora was deployed in Scandinavia and Alaska

* The system has enabled us to capture the fine-scale spatio-temporal variations of pulsating aurora in a wide area

* Data from those instruments have also been used for simultaneous observations of pulsating aurora with the Arase satellite
