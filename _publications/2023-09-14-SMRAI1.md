Physics-based simulations are important for elucidating the fundamental mechanisms behind the time-varying complex ionospheric conditions, such as ionospheric potential, against unprecedented solar wind variations incident on the Earthâ€™s magnetosphere. However, carrying out an extensive parameter survey for comprehending the nonlinear solar wind density dependence of the ionospheric potential, for example, requires state-of-the-art global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, which cannot be executed efficiently even on large-scale cluster computers. Here, we report the performance of a machine-learning based surrogate model for estimating the ionospheric potential outputs of a global MHD simulation, using the reservoir computing technique called echo state network (ESN). The trained ESN-based emulator demonstrates exceptional speed in conducting the parameter survey, which can lead to the identification of a solar wind density dependence of the ionospheric polar cap potential. Finally, we discuss future directions including the promising application for space weather forecasting.
