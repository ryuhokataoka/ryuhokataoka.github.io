* The solar energetic particle (SEP) effects on the neutral chemical composition in the Martian atmosphere are investigated by numerical simulations

* Ozone depletion due to enhanced HOx during a large SEP event could be detected by Trace Gas Orbiter/Nadir and Occultation for MArs Discovery

* Chemical pathways leading to ozone depletion on Mars differ from those on Earth
