* Atmospheric ionization by energetic particles is examined for September 2017 space weather event

* Solar X-rays, solar protons, and radiation belt electrons as observed by satellites are used for Particle and Heavy Ion Transport code System (PHITS)-simulation inputs

* Those ionizations in the mesosphere measured by ground-based instruments are reasonably reproduced by the PHITS simulation
