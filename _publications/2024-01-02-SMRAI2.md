Physics-based auroral simulations, such as Japanese REProduce Plasma Universe (REPPU) code, are not practically fast enough for the purpose of real-time space weather forecast, even using the designated super computers. Here we developed a million-times-faster gemulatorh to surrogate the outputs of the physics-based simulation, using the machine-learning technique called Echo State Network. The newly developed emulator, the surrogate model for REPPU auroral Ionosphere version 2 (SMRAI2) enables us to realize the real-time forecast of the auroral current system.
