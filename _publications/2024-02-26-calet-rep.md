Earth's radiation belts contain high energy electrons, hazardous to both humans and electronics in space. This population exhibits dramatic variations in time, showing both rapid enhancements as well as depletions. One potential cause of these depletions is the loss of these electrons into Earth's atmosphere, through a process termed “precipitation.” While precipitation has been shown to contribute to the global dynamics of the radiation belts, when, where, and how much loss it contributes are still open questions. This study examines the spatial and temporal evolution of radiation belt electron precipitation as well as the electromagnetic waves that can cause it.
