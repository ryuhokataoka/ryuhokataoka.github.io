I propose the hypothesis that the 100-day-long light event as seen from Kasumi around the Fall of the third year of Oan (1370 A.D.) as written in the historical record "Tenno Onyogo Engi" in the "Hyogo Shrines Magazine" is an aurora borealis (so-called “red sign”), which is rarely seen in Japan. Unfortunately, this document exists only in the printed form. Fortunately, I have found the related record "Tajima Mikumigun Uzukishimayama Chofukuji Engi " and I test the hypothesis based on both historical documents. Further I consult "Kyurei Zojiki", another well-known historical document about the recurrent red sign events in Winter of 1370 as seen from Kyoto. If we assume the duration of the light event of Kasumi was described as approximate numbers, we can consider the possibility of red sign, since the red sign can be found at about the same time and in a wide range of areas. This study is interesting as it attempts to confirm the geophysical conclusion that red sign can be found in Japan from historical documents, and also in that it allows us to confirm how people dictated the phenomenon.
