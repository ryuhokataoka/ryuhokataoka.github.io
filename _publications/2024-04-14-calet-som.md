Fast electrons are normally trapped by the Earthâ€™s magnetic field. However, they often get released in bursts and impact the upper layers of the atmosphere near the poles. The underlying processes are still not well understood and debated. In this study we use an unsupervised artificial intelligence technique called Self-Organizing-Maps (SOM) to automatically detect and classify the observations made by a charged particle detector onboard the International Space Station (ISS). The SOM categorizes the bursts based on their variability and group together observations by their similarity. We compare the categorization with the spatial location of the electron bursts. Clear patterns are observed and compared with past categorizations attempts.
