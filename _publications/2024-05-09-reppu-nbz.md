From the global simulation, we reproduce the solar wind‐magnetosphere‐ionosphere (S‐M‐I) 
interaction under the northward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) with negative By. Reconnection structures,
the plasma sheet, and lobes are formed in magnetospheric convection, while lobe/round‐merging/reciprocal/
nightside cells appear in the ionosphere...
