Relativistic electron precipitation (REP) refers to the release, toward the upper atmosphere, of high energy electrons initially trapped in a torus shaped region around Earth known as the outer Van Allen radiation belt. REP is relevant as it contributes to the fast depletion of the electrons from this region. This study presents a statistical analysis of the REP observations made by the Calorimetric Electron Telescope (CALET) experiment on board the International Space Station (2015â€“present). Data from CALET experiment reveals a previously unreported 6-month periodicity similar to those observed for high energy electrons in the outer belt.
