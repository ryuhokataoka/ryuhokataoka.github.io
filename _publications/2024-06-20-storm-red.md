Citizen scientists identified an unusually bright red aurora from Hokkaido, Japan during a not-so-unusual magnetic storm on 1 December 2023. The large dynamic pressure, driven by large density of >50/cc, contributed to a small magnetopause and the effects observed at such low latitude. The hypothesis of this study is that the loss of ring current particles across the small-size magnetopause played an important role. Also, we discuss that Hokkaido was at the right position to see the direct effect of storm-time substorm.
