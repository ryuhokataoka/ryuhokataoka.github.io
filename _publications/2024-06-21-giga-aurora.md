Revealing the origins of aurorae in Earth’s polar cap has long been a challenge since direct precipitation of energetic electrons from the magnetosphere is not always expected in this region of open magnetic field lines. Here, we introduce an exceptionally gigantic aurora filling the entire polar cap region on a day when the solar wind had almost disappeared. By combining ground-based and satellite observations, we proved that this unique aurora was produced by suprathermal electrons streaming directly from the Sun, which is known as “polar rain.” High-sensitivity imaging from the ground has visualized complex spatial structures of the polar rain aurora possibly manifesting the internal pattern of the solar wind or even the organizations in the chromosphere of the Sun.
