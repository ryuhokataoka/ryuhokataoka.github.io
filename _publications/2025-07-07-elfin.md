- Three types of electron precipitation are investigated: those driven by EMIC waves, whistler-mode waves, and field-line curvature scattering

- We use measurements from CALET&MAXI onboard the ISS to statistically compare the occurrence rates of these precipitation types

- We use ELFIN observations to develop an algorithm for identifying different precipitation types in CALET&MAXI/ISS data
