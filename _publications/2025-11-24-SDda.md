The ionospheric condition can be predicted by a machine-learning-based model that mimics a numerical simulation model of the magnetosphere–ionosphere system. We assess this machine-learning-based model based on radar observations in the polar ionosphere. We have also developed a method to estimate the state of the polar ionosphere by combining the model prediction and radar observations. The results reproduced the variability of the polar ionosphere. The proposed method is a promising approach for investigating the polar ionospheric phenomena.
