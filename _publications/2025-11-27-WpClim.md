1. The seasonal and universal-time (UT) variations of the Pi2 occurrence rate are examined by analyzing the Wp index

2. The results show that the seasonal and UT variations of Pi2 pulsations are mostly controlled by the equinoctial effect

3. An analysis with a machine-learning-based model shows that the Russell-McPherron and axial effects hardly affect the Pi2 occurrence rate
