Ryuho Kataoka, auroraXcosmic project

National Institute of Polar Research 

We report the latest development status of international all-sky camera network over Antarctica under the auroraXcosmic project (NIPR/JARE/AJ1007, 3rd year of 6 year project). We successfully started two-wavelength observations (391.4 nm and 630.0 nm) at Syowa station since March 2023, and we will install identical observation suites at Davis and Casey stations in the polar cap area since March 2025. Further, we will install modified versions at Dumont d’Urville and Concordia (˜magnetic pole) stations since March 2025. We discuss the future development (wind generator system etc.) to realize the unmanned observation at Dome Fuji II.
