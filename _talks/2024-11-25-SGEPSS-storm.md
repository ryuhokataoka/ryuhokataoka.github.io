This is invited talk.

Ryuho Kataoka, 1National Institute of Polar Research 

I would like to report a citizen science-motivated studies on the cause of an unusually bright red aurora as witnessed from Hokkaido, Japan during a magnetic storm on 1 December 2023 (Kataoka et al., 2024, GRL), as well as a vast magenta aurora as observed from wide area of Japan, including Kyoto, during a severe storm on 11 May 2024 (Kataoka et al., 2024, under review). Another latest citizen science example of 12 Aug 2024 storm (Dst peak at-203 nT) will also be shown for comparison.
